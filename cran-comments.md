## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Regarding the issues raised:

* There are no methods-related references to include.

* I added \value to grapes-greater-than-grapes.Rd

* I removed if(FALSE) and adapted the examples in save_plot.Rd

* I wrapped some save_plot.Rd examples in \donttest{} because they were taking slightly over 5 seconds.

## R CMD check results

‚ùØ checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
  unable to verify current time
  
This appears to be an issue with the clock server, and not with this package.

* This is a new release.
