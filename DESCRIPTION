Description: The goal of `tidyplots` is make to it ridiculously simple to create scientific plots by gradually adding, changing and adjusting plot components. It follows a similar logic as `ggplot2`, but uses the pipe `%>%` instead of `+`, which allows for more flexible and powerful workflows. Moreover, `tidyplot` is making the most common scientific plotting routines more accessible, by proving a clean and minimalist interface. Finally, you can always `add()` ggplot code, to handle those cases where you need full control.
