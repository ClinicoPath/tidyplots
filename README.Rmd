# tidyplots

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of `tidyplots` is make to it ridiculously simple to create scientific plots by gradually adding, changing and adjusting plot components. It follows a similar logic as `ggplot2`, but uses the pipe `%>%` instead of `+`, which allows for more flexible and powerful workflows. Moreover, `tidyplots` is making the most common scientific plotting routines more accessible, by proving a clean and minimalist interface. Finally, you can always `add()` ggplot code, to handle those cases where you need full control.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tidyplots` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jbengler/tidyplots")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tidyplots)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
